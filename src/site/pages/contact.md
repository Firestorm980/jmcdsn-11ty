Getting a hold of me is easy. Drop me a line with the form on this page if you’re interested in working together or just to contact me and say “Hi!”

I’m also on LinkedIn, Twitter, and Github. Keep track of <a href="https://github.com/Firestorm980/">me on Github</a> to see what side projects I’m working on right now. <a href="https://twitter.com/jonmchristensen">Follow me on Twitter</a> if you like hearing my nerdy thoughts about web, entertainment and other things. Unfortunately, I don’t usually respond to <a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Owl#Postal_workers">messages by owl</a>.

If you’re looking for more official things, you can take a look at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jon-christensen-2768381a/">my LinkedIn profile</a>.
