I'll admit, I'm a little frustrated. Originally, I was going to title this post "Giving a Shit", but I'm sure a few people would take some umbridge with that. Regardless, that is the sentiment I am feeling at the moment.

Why am I feeling this way? For years, I was unaware of the importance of accessibility in our work. Then I worked on a school website and took a deep dive and it all changed.

Accessibility issues touch all of us in one way or another. Indirectly or directly. We have all been, are currently, or will be effected by some kind of disability in our lives. Not just people we know. Not just stats in our analytics. Us as individuals.

## Stuck in the mud

I've had several instances over the past couple weeks where accessibility has been basically brought down to a check on the site checklist. The "simple" question of: "Did we meet WCAG 2.0 AA?" when there is so much that WCAG 2.0 AA doesn't cover. Many times, we've met the _technical_ requirements, but have gone no further.

Beyond that, there is a passing of responsibility.
- Other disciplines don't have to think about accessibility earlier in the process.
- Our plugins shouldn't default to inclusive settings.
- Analytics "prove" our users aren't disabled.
- We shouldn't burden our client with having to make accessible content.
- We want this feature from a third party and we don't have time to make it accessible.

After years of working to advocate and push for awareness and integration of accessibility into the workflow at my current place of work, it is so frustrating to still have so many people in multiple disciples to just not "get" it. If they did, I don't think these would be things that would come up. It would just be understood.

## Le sigh

This is no longer an issue of awareness. Now it is an issue of empathy. Seeing our users in ourselves. If we consider our accessibility job "done" when we've met the legal responsibility and gone no further, have we really done _that much_ good? Are we really showing that accessibility matters to us as a core trait?

There are so many spots that just don't meet the level of quality that I want or expect. We're _legally_ fine, but that does such a disservice to _actual users_ if that is where we stop.
